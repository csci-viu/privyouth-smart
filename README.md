PrivYouth-Smart
Overview
Empowering Young Canadians in the Smart Device Era
This repository supports PrivYouth-Smart, a research and public engagement initiative focused on empowering youth to navigate the privacy implications of smart devices. Funded by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC), this project applies a privacy-by-design approach to develop evidence-based tools, educational resources, and research outputs aimed at protecting youth in digitally pervasive environments.

We bring together researchers, educators, policymakers, parents, and developers to foster privacy awareness and co-design privacy-conscious solutions for the next generation of connected technology.

Objectives
Examine youth understanding, behavior, and concerns related to smart device data practices.

Design and evaluate privacy-by-design frameworks tailored to youth-centered technologies.

Facilitate public engagement through participatory workshops, focus groups, and outreach activities.

Promote privacy literacy and critical awareness among youth and key stakeholders.

Contribute to national discourse on ethical technology development and youth data protection.
